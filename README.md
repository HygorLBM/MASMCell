# MASMCell
This is a Spreadsheet editor programmed in MASM32 Assembly.

This software treats each variable as a character, not integer, and that decision made me move away from math features,
focusing  instead on interface functionality and save/load as files.

This spreadsheet is capable of:

⦁	Creating a new empty spreadsheet, 4x5.

⦁	Add/remove lines into a spreadsheet (max: 8)

⦁	Add/remove columns into a spreadsheet(max: 6)

⦁	Edit fields,lines and columns.

⦁	Save the spreadsheet into .txt file

⦁	Load the last spreadsheet

This project uses the assembly library Irvine32 to properly work and was built using Microsoft Visual Studios.
